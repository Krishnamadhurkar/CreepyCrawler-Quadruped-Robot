%% Step 1: COPY-PASTE YOUR SOLUTION FOR THE JOINT VELOCITIES AND ACCELERATIONS BELOW
%% Robot Definition:
n = 2;    % Number of links in the kinematic chain
% L1 = 0.3; % [m] Length of the first link
% L2 = 0.4; % [m] Length of the second link
m1 = 1;   % [kg] Mass of the first link
m2 = 1;   % [kg] Mass of the second link
g = -9.8;  % [m/s2] Gravity acceleration (aligned with the Y axis)
syms L1 L2
%% *** STEP 1 ***
% Calculate the home configurations of each link, expressed in the space frame                
M1 = [1 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1]; % pose of frame {1} expressed in the {0} (space) reference frame
M2 = [1 0 0 L1; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1]; % pose of frame {2} expressed in the {0} (space) reference frame
M3 = [1 0 0 L1+L2; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1]; % pose of frame {3} expressed in the {0} (space) reference frame
